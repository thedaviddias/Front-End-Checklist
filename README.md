## How to use?

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Disclaimer:** This checklist is based on Front-End developers' years of experience, with additions from other open-source checklists.
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

All items in the **Front-End Checklist** are required for the majority of the projects, but some elements can be omitted
or are not essential (in the case of an administration web app, you may not need RSS feed for example). We choose to use
3 levels of flexibility:

- ![Low][low_img] indicates that the item is recommended but can be omitted in certain situations.
- ![Medium][medium_img] indicates that the item is highly recommended but can potentially be omitted in very specific
  cases. However, omitting these elements can negatively impact performance or SEO.
- ![High][high_img] indicates that the item cannot be omitted under any circumstances. Removing these elements may
  result in page malfunctions or cause accessibility and SEO issues. Testing should prioritize these elements first.

Some resources possess an emoticon to help you understand which type of content / help you may find on the checklist:

- üìñ: documentation or article
- üõ†: online tool / testing tool
- üìπ: media or video content

## Head

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
> [!NOTE]
> You can find [a list of everything](https://github.com/joshbuchea/HEAD) that could be found in the `<head>` of an HTML document.
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

### Meta tag

- [ ] **Doctype:** ![High][high_img] The Doctype is HTML5 and is at the top of all your HTML pages.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html
<!doctype html><!-- HTML5 -->
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

  [Determining the character encoding - HTML5 W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#determining-the-character-encoding)

_The next 2 meta tags (Charset and Viewport) need to come first in the head._

- [ ] **Charset:** ![High][high_img] The charset (UTF-8) is declared correctly.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html
<!-- Set character encoding for the document -->
<meta charset="utf-8">
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

- [ ] **Viewport:** ![High][high_img] The viewport is declared correctly.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html
<!-- Viewport for responsive web design -->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover">
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

- [ ] **Title:** ![High][high_img] A title is used on all pages (SEO: Google calculates the pixel width of the characters used in the title, and it cuts off between 472 and 482 pixels. The average character limit would be around 55-characters).

```html
<!-- Document Title -->
<title>Page Title less than 55 characters</title>
```

- [ ] **Favicons:** ![Medium][medium_img] Each favicon has been created and displays correctly. If you have only a
      `favicon.ico`, put it at the root of your site. Normally you won't need to use any markup. However, it's still
      good practice to link to it using the example below. Today, **PNG format is recommended** over `.ico` format
      (dimensions: 32x32px).

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```html
<!-- Standard favicon -->
<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="https://example.com/favicon.ico">
<!-- Recommended favicon format -->
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="https://example.com/favicon.png">

- [ ] **RSS feed:** ![Low][low_img] If your project is a blog or has articles, an RSS link was provided.

- [ ] **CSS Critical:** ![Medium][medium_img] The CSS critical (or "above the fold") collects all the CSS used to render
      the visible portion of the page. It is embedded before your principal CSS call and between `<style></style>` in a

### Social meta

Visualize and generate automatically our social meta tags with [Meta Tags](https://metatags.io/)

**_Facebook OG_** and **_Twitter Cards_** are, for any website, highly recommended. The other social media tags can be
considered if you target a particular presence on those and want to ensure the display.

- [ ] **Facebook Open Graph:** ![Low][low_img] All Facebook Open Graph (OG) are tested and no one is missing or with
      false information. Images need to be at least 600 x 315 pixels, although 1200 x 630 pixels is recommended.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
> [!NOTE]
> Using `og:image:width` and `og:image:height` will specify the image dimensions to the crawler so that it can render the image immediately without having to asynchronously download and process it.

- [ ] **`noscript` tag:** ![Medium][medium_img] Use `<noscript>` tag in the HTML body if a script type on the page is
      unsupported or if scripting is currently turned off in the browser. This will be helpful in client-side rendering
      heavy apps such as React.js, see
      [examples](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/quick-tip-dont-forget-the-noscript-element--cms-25498).

## Performance

### Best practices

- [ ] **Goals to achieve:** ![Medium][medium_img] Your pages should reach these goals:

  - First Meaningful Paint under 1 second
  - Time To Interactive under 5 seconds for the "average" configuration (a $200 Android on a slow 3G network with 400ms
    RTT and 400kbps transfer speed) and under 2 seconds for repeat visits
  - Critical file size under 170Kb gzipped

- üõ† [Website Page Analysis](https://tools.pingdom.com)
- üõ† [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/)
- üìñ [Size Limit: Make the Web lighter](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/size-limit-make-the-web-lighter)

- [ ] **Minified HTML:** ![Medium][medium_img] Your HTML is minified.

- [ ] **Lazy loading:** ![Medium][medium_img] Images, scripts and CSS need to be lazy loaded to improve the response
      time of the current page (See details in their respective sections).

- [ ] **Cookie size:** ![Medium][medium_img] If you are using cookies be sure each cookie doesn't exceed 4096 bytes and
      your domain name doesn't have more than 20 cookies.

- üìñ [Cookie specification: RFC 6265](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265)
- üìñ [Cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies)
- üõ† [Browser Cookie Limits](http://browsercookielimits.squawky.net/)

- [ ] **Third party components:** ![Medium][medium_img] Third party iframes or components relying on external JS (like
      sharing buttons) are replaced by static components when possible, thus limiting calls to external APIs and keeping
      your user's activity private.

- üõ† [Simple sharing buttons generator](https://simplesharingbuttons.com/)

### Preparing upcoming requests

- üìñ [Explanation of the following techniques](https://css-tricks.com/prefetching-preloading-prebrowsing/)

- [ ] **DNS resolution:** ![Low][low_img] DNS of third-party services that may be needed are resolved in advance during
      idle time using `dns-prefetch`.

```html
<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://example.com" />
```

- [ ] **Preconnection:** ![Low][low_img] DNS lookup, TCP handshake and TLS negotiation with services that will be needed
      soon is done in advance during idle time using `preconnect`.

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://example.com" />
```

- [ ] **Prefetching:** ![Low][low_img] Resources that will be needed soon (e.g. lazy loaded images) are requested in
      advance during idle time using `prefetch`.

```html
<link rel="prefetch" href="image.png" />
```

- [ ] **Preloading:** ![Low][low_img] Resources needed in the current page (e.g. scripts placed at the end of `<body>`)
      in advance using `preload`.

```html
<link rel="preload" href="app.js" />
```

### Performance testing

- [ ] **Google PageSpeed:** ![High][high_img] All your pages were tested (not only the homepage) and have a score of at
      least 90/100.

### Semantics

- [ ] **Specific HTML5 input types are used:** ![Medium][medium_img] This is especially important for mobile devices
      that show customized keypads and widgets for different types.

- üìñ [Mobile Input Types](http://mobileinputtypes.com/)

### Form

- [ ] **Label:** ![High][high_img] A label is associated with each input form element. In case a label can't be
      displayed, use `aria-label` instead.

- üìñ
  [Using the aria-label attribute - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label)

### Accessibility testing

- [ ] **Accessibility standards testing:** ![High][high_img] Use the WAVE tool to test if your page respects the
      accessibility standards.

- üõ† [Wave testing](http://wave.webaim.org/)

- [ ] **Keyboard navigation:** ![High][high_img] Test your website using only your keyboard in a previsible order. All
      interactive elements are reachable and usable.
- [ ] **Screen-reader:** ![Medium][medium_img] All pages were tested in a screen-reader (VoiceOver, ChromeVox, NVDA or
      Lynx).
- [ ] **Focus style:** ![High][high_img] If the focus is disabled, it is replaced by visible state in CSS.

- üìπ
