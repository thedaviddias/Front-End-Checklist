## How to use?

All items in the **Front-End Checklist** are required for the majority of the projects, but some elements can be omitted or are not essential (in the case of an administration web app, you may not need RSS feed for example). We choose to use 3 levels of flexibility:

* ![Low][low_img] means that the item is **recommended** but can be omitted in some particular situations.
* ![Medium][medium_img] means that the item is **highly recommended** and can eventually be omitted in some really particular cases. Some elements, if omitted, can have bad repercussions in terms of performance or SEO.
* ![High][high_img] means that the item **can't be omitted** by any reason. You may cause a dysfunction in your page or have accessibility or SEO issues. The testing priority needs to be on these elements first.

Some resources possess an emoticon to help you understand which type of content / help you may find on the checklist:

* 📖: documentation or article
* 🛠: online tool / testing tool
* 📹: media or video content

> You can contribute to the ***Front-End Checklist App*** reading the [CONTRIBUTING.md file](https://github.com/thedaviddias/Front-End-Checklist/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) which explains everything about the project.

## Head

> **Notes:** You can find [a list of everything](https://github.com/joshbuchea/HEAD) that could be found in the `<head>` of an HTML document.

### Meta tag

* [ ] **Doctype:** ![High][high_img] The Doctype is HTML5 and is at the top of all your HTML pages.

```html
<!doctype html> <!-- HTML5 -->
```

> * 📖 [Determining the character encoding - HTML5 W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#determining-the-character-encoding)

*The next 2 meta tags (Charset and Viewport) need to come first in the head.*

* [ ] **Charset:** ![High][high_img] The charset (UTF-8) is declared correctly.

```html
<!-- Set character encoding for the document -->
<meta charset="utf-8">
```

* [ ] **Viewport:** ![High][high_img] The viewport is declared correctly.

```html
<!-- Viewport for responsive web design -->
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover">
```

* [ ] **Title:** ![High][high_img] A title is used on all pages (SEO: Google calculates the pixel width of the characters used in the title, and it cuts off between 472 and 482 pixels. The average character limit would be around 55-characters).

```html
<!-- Document Title -->
<title>Page Title less than 55 characters</title>
```

> * 📖 [Title - HTML - MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/title)
> * 🛠 [SERP Snippet Generator](https://www.sistrix.com/serp-snippet-generator/)

* [ ] **Favicons:** ![Medium][medium_img] Each favicon has been created and displays correctly. If you have only a `favicon.ico`, put it at the root of your site. Normally you won't need to use any markup. However, it's still good practice to link to it using the example below. Today, **PNG format is recommended** over `.ico` format (dimensions: 32x32px).

```html
<!-- Standard favicon -->
<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="https://example.com/favicon.ico">
<!-- Recommended favicon format -->
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="https://example.com/favicon.png">

* [ ] **Windows Tiles:** ![Low][low_img] Windows tiles are present and linked.

```html
<!-- Microsoft Tiles -->
<meta name="msapplication-config" content="browserconfig.xml" />
```

Minimum required xml markup for the `browserconfig.xml` file is as follows:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<browserconfig>
   <msapplication>
     <tile>
        <square70x70logo src="small.png"/>
        <square150x150logo src="medium.png"/>

* [ ] **Canonical:** ![Medium][medium_img] Use `rel="canonical"` to avoid duplicate content.

```html
<!-- Helps prevent duplicate content issues -->
<link rel="canonical" href="http://example.com/2017/09/a-new-article-to-read.html">
```

> * 📖 [Use canonical URLs - Search Console Help - Google Support](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/139066?hl=en)

* [ ] **RSS feed:** ![Low][low_img] If your project is a blog or has articles, an RSS link was provided.

* [ ] **CSS Critical:** ![Medium][medium_img] The CSS critical (or "above the fold") collects all the CSS used to render the visible portion of the page. It is embedded before your principal CSS call and between `<style></style>` in a single line (minified).

> * 🛠 [Critical by Addy Osmani on GitHub](https://github.com/addyosmani/critical) automates this.

* [ ] **CSS order:** ![High][high_img] All CSS files are loaded before any JavaScript files in the `<head>`. (Except the case where sometimes JS files are loaded asynchronously on top of your page).

### Social meta

Visualize and generate automatically our social meta tags with [Meta Tags](https://metatags.io/)

***Facebook OG*** and ***Twitter Cards*** are, for any website, highly recommended. The other social media tags can be considered if you target a particular presence on those and want to ensure the display.

* [ ] **Facebook Open Graph:** ![Low][low_img] All Facebook Open Graph (OG) are tested and no one is missing or with false information. Images need to be at least 600 x 315 pixels, although 1200 x 630 pixels is recommended.

> **Notes:** Using `og:image:width` and `og:image:height` will specify the image dimensions to the crawler so that it can render the image immediately without having to asynchronously download and process it.

```html
<meta property="og:type" content="website">
<meta property="og:url" content="https://example.com/page.html">
<meta property="og:title" content="Content Title">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://example.com/image.jpg">
<meta property="og:description" content="Description Here">
<meta property="og:site_name" content="Site Name">
<meta property="og:locale" content="en_US">
<!-- Next tags are optional but recommended -->
<meta property="og:image:width" content="1200">
<meta property="og:image:height" content="630">

## Performance

### Best practices

* [ ] **Goals to achieve:** ![Medium][medium_img] Your pages should reach these goals:
  * First Meaningful Paint under 1 second
  * Time To Interactive under 5 seconds for the "average" configuration (a $200 Android on a slow 3G network with 400ms RTT and 400kbps transfer speed) and under 2 seconds for repeat visits
  * Critical file size under 170Kb gzipped

> * 🛠 [Website Page Analysis](https://tools.pingdom.com)
> * 🛠 [WebPageTest](https://www.webpagetest.org/)
> * 📖 [Size Limit: Make the Web lighter](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/size-limit-make-the-web-lighter)

* [ ] **Minified HTML:** ![Medium][medium_img] Your HTML is minified.

* [ ] **Lazy loading:** ![Medium][medium_img] Images, scripts and CSS need to be lazy loaded to improve the response time of the current page (See details in their respective sections).

* [ ] **Cookie size:** ![Medium][medium_img] If you are using cookies be sure each cookie doesn't exceed 4096 bytes and your domain name doesn't have more than 20 cookies.

> * 📖 [Cookie specification: RFC 6265](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6265)
> * 📖 [Cookies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies)
> * 🛠 [Browser Cookie Limits](http://browsercookielimits.squawky.net/)

* [ ] **Third party components:** ![Medium][medium_img] Third party iframes or components relying on external JS (like sharing buttons) are replaced by static components when possible, thus limiting calls to external APIs and keeping your user's activity private.

> * 🛠 [Simple sharing buttons generator](https://simplesharingbuttons.com/)

### Preparing upcoming requests

> * 📖 [Explanation of the following techniques](https://css-tricks.com/prefetching-preloading-prebrowsing/)

* [ ] **DNS resolution:** ![Low][low_img] DNS of third-party services that may be needed are resolved in advance during idle time using `dns-prefetch`.

```html
<link rel="dns-prefetch" href="https://example.com">
```

* [ ] **Preconnection:** ![Low][low_img] DNS lookup, TCP handshake and TLS negotiation with services that will be needed soon is done in advance during idle time using `preconnect`.

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://example.com">
```

* [ ] **Prefetching:** ![Low][low_img] Resources that will be needed soon (e.g. lazy loaded images) are requested in advance during idle time using `prefetch`.

```html
<link rel="prefetch" href="image.png">
```

* [ ] **Preloading:** ![Low][low_img] Resources needed in the current page (e.g. scripts placed at the end of `<body>`) in advance using `preload`.

```html
<link rel="preload" href="app.js">
```

> * 📖 [Difference between prefetch and preload](https://medium.com/reloading/preload-prefetch-and-priorities-in-chrome-776165961bbf)

### Performance testing

* [ ] **Google PageSpeed:** ![High][high_img] All your pages were tested (not only the homepage) and have a score of at least 90/100.
