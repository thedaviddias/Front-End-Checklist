The **Front-End Checklist** is an exhaustive list of all elements you need to have / to test before launching your site / page HTML to production.

It is based on Front-End developers' years of experience, with the additions coming from some other open-source checklists.

## Table of Contents

1. **[How to use](#how-to-use)**
2. **[Head](#head)**
3. **[HTML](#html)**
4. **[Webfonts](#webfonts)**
5. **[CSS](#css)**
6. **[Images](#images)**
7. **[JavaScript](#javascript)**
8. **[Security](#security)**
9. **[Performance](#performance-1)**
10. **[Accessibility](#accessibility)**
11. **[SEO](#seo)**

## How to use?

All items in the **Front-End Checklist** are required for the majority of the projects, but some elements can be omitted or are not essential (in the case of an administration web app, you may not need RSS feed for example). We choose to use 3 levels of flexibility:

* ![Low][low_img] means that the item is **recommended** but can be omitted in some particular situations.
* ![Medium][medium_img] means that the item is **highly recommended** and can eventually be omitted in some really particular cases. Some elements, if omitted, can have bad repercussions in terms of performance or SEO.
* ![High][high_img] means that the item **can't be omitted** by any reason. You may cause a dysfunction in your page or have accessibility or SEO issues. The testing priority needs to be on these elements first.

Some resources possess an emoticon to help you understand which type of content / help you may find on the checklist:

* 📖: documentation or article
* 🛠: online tool / testing tool
* 📹: media or video content

## Head

> **Notes:** You can find [a list of everything](https://github.com/joshbuchea/HEAD) that could be found in the `<head>` of an HTML document.

### Meta tag

* [ ] **Doctype:** ![High][high_img] The Doctype is HTML5 and is at the top of all your HTML pages.

```html
<!-- Doctype HTML5 -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

> 📖 [Determining the character encoding - HTML5 W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/syntax.html#determining-the-character-encoding)

*The next 3 meta tags (Charset, X-UA Compatible and Viewport) need to come first in the head.*

* [ ] **Charset:** ![High][high_img] The charset declared (UTF-8) is declared correctly.

```html
<!-- Set character encoding for the document -->
<meta charset="utf-8">
```

* [ ] **X-UA-Compatible:** ![Medium][medium_img] The X-UA-Compatible meta tag is present.

```html
<!-- Instruct Internet Explorer to use its latest rendering engine -->
<meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=edge">

Normally you won't need to use any markup. However, it's still good practice to link to it using the example below. Today, **PNG format is recommended** over `.ico` format (dimensions: 32x32px).

```html
<!-- Standard favicon -->
<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="https://example.com/favicon.ico" />

* [ ] **CSS order:** ![High][high_img] All CSS files are loaded before any JavaScript files in the `<head>`. (Except the case where sometimes JS files are loaded asynchronously on top of your page).

* [ ] **Facebook Open Graph:** ![Low][low_img] All Facebook Open Graph (OG) are tested and no one is missing or with a false information. Images need to be at least 600 x 315 pixels, 1200 x 630 pixels recommended.
